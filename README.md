Timed-Screencapture
===================

Simple bash script for OS X that takes screencaps at specified time intervals. Images are saved on the user's Desktop in a new folder called screens.

To run, execute as a bash script where the first argument is the time, in seconds, to wait between each screencap:  

    bash screencap.sh 5
will take screencaps at 5-second intervals until stopped by Ctrl-C.
